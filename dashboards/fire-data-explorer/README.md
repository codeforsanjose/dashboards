What is this?
-------------
An interactive visualization for exploring fire incidents in January 2015 [data from the City of San Jose](http://data.sanjoseca.gov/home).

Cool libraries on which this is based.
--------------------------------------
This project is primarily intended as a tech demo/mashup of the following technologies:
* [Square](http://square.github.io)'s [crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) - for filtering
* [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) - for interactive charts
* [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) - for maps
* [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) - for map point clustering
* [Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) - for open data
